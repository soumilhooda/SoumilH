            It all began in August 2023, a pivotal moment in my pursuit of degrees in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and Physics. At that juncture, I harbored aspirations for a PhD in machine learning, particularly focusing on fields such as Remote Sensing or Generalized Autonomy Models, which deeply engaged my academic interests.
            </p>

            <p>
            While seeking thesis opportunities for my final year, I encountered significant challenges. Most positions required candidates pursuing PhDs or were restricted to international applicants. I had progressed in discussions with the Wenshan Wang group at CMU for developing multi-modal models for off-road driving vehicles, but the talks fell through, leaving me disheartened. I ceased applying after a few unsuccessful attempts.
            </p>

            <p>
            During this period of introspection and personal challenges, a chance encounter with a news headline in the campus library profoundly altered my perspective. The headline highlighted Citadel's meteorological team from the University of Reading, whose expertise in weather forecasting had translated into billions in profits through oil trading. This convergence of meteorology and finance sparked a new fascination, prompting me to explore unconventional applications of my modest expertise in weather modeling. I often mused that had I not pursued the sciences, economics might have been my alternative path.
            </p>

            <p>
            I reached out to my friend Shubham Sharma (BITS Pilani Hyderabad, Mechanical Eng + Chemistry (Batch of 2025)) to explore potential collaborations leveraging his financial acumen and my interest in commodities markets. However, our initial attempts at projects over the next few months faltered due to a lack of genuine passion for the field and the challenges we faced in identifying impactful problems. We suspended our efforts when the semester concluded in December 2023, having made no significant headway.
            </p>

            <p>
            Fast forward to February 2024, when I had decided to secure an internship at JPMorganChase (a short lived aspiration of mine) through the Practice School process at BITS Pilani. Despite my limited background in finance, I sought a role that aligned well with my experience in climate risk modeling—a niche where my weather expertise could uniquely contribute. To compensate for my lack of formal finance education, I delved deeper into projects at the intersection of finance and meteorology.
            </p>

            <p>
            After a rigorous review of various materials, including insights from the CME group on weather-based derivatives, which were currently facing challenges in the market, I often discussed these topics with friends over meals.
            </p>

            <p>
            One evening, after returning from the gym, I discussed with Shubham my idea to collaborate on modeling temperature-based derivatives. He was equally enthusiastic, and we embarked on our journey by researching online materials, identifying areas for improvement, and initiating coding efforts. While Shubham was not proficient in coding, I took on extensive coding responsibilities, running experiments to price and forecast models. Data cleaning became a major focus, encompassing diverse datasets which I will detail shortly. At this stage, I must admit that I had little practical understanding of finance. Despite my interest, I lacked knowledge about F&O markets and hedge mechanisms. Nevertheless, we persevered, learning from each other along the way.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
            After a week of intense daily shifts lasting 17 hours, we completed our first joint project: designing HDD/CDD contracts tailored for summer and winter seasons across eight Indian cities. Leveraging my prior internship experiences, our model achieved exceptional accuracy in forecasting temperature profiles. Shubham's innovative approach to reference temperature value modeling further enhanced our pricing accuracy compared to existing industry products.
            </p>

            <p>
            At this point, some friends nearby took note and grew interested in our work. This was when we delved deeply into industry research and discovered a significant gap in such products within India—a promising market opportunity. Serendipitously, on March 1, 2024, SEBI regulated weather-based financial products, legitimizing our efforts. We expanded our team to include Kunal Bansal (BITS Pilani Hyderabad, Comp Sci Eng + Chemistry (Batch of 2025)), and embarked on collecting data for more ambitious projects, aiming to create derivatives for wind and rainfall. We also identified several shortcomings in our existing products and sought to address them through advanced swaps and N-dimensional quantos. Our work involved meticulous data analysis across various sectors, including agriculture, energy, and transportation. We processed extensive datasets ranging from trading rates and crop water requirements to commodity spot prices, electricity consumption, renewable energy production, and coal production and much, much more. The demanding nature of our work required high temporal resolution and rigorous analysis of industry trends and data patterns. During Kunal's absence due to personal commitments, Shubham and I pulled multiple 23-hour shifts to maintain momentum.

            <p>
            Subsequently, we welcomed Utkarsh Agarwal (BITS Pilani Hyderabad, Comp Sci Eng + Physics (Batch of 2025)) and Chaitanya Dandwate (BITS Pilani Hyderabad, Chemical Eng (Batch of 2024)) to our team. Utkarsh brought legal acumen, while Chaitanya provided valuable consultancy based on his internship at Deutsche Bank. Together, we began developing alternatives to the PMFBY and WBCIS insurance schemes in India. We built a lot of products, some survived our stress testing and some did not.

            </div>


            <p>
            I engaged in extensive discussions with small warehouse owners, farmers, and medium-scale renewable energy companies to understand their needs better. Our products underwent rigorous stress testing, and I developed detailed extreme-case testing code. We compiled comprehensive analysis decks and pitched our findings to investment banks, insurance companies, and boutique risk management firms. Despite our initial successes, our team faced challenges as individual responsibilities diverged. Engaging with industry professionals—underwriters, chief officers, and product directors—revealed the complexities of scaling our venture without robust legal support and substantial capital investment. Nonetheless, I remain committed to completing manuscripts on our research, intending to make our findings and methodologies open-source. I would like to thank the following people for having very detailed interactions with me, Marcel Reif at Munich Re, Niraj Shah at Munich Re, Devanshu Sood at JPMorganChase, Ralph Renner at Parameter Climate and Vivek Pawale at Parameter Climate.

            <p>
            The semester-long experience was transformative. It encompassed research, market analysis, product development, team-building, pitching, iterative improvements, and more. Our early steps toward registering our venture, Dyaus Investments, and discussions with legal student friends at GNLU reflected our determination to pursue entrepreneurship. Many around me inquired about our progress and sought to learn from our journey, marking the beginning of my potential entrepreneurial path.

            <p>
            Currently I am interning at Texas Instruments as a Digital Intern. I have moved away from my work on weather derivatives. I aim to leverage my EEE background and pursue further studies in Computer Engineering. My goal is to innovate and contribute meaningfully to the field in my future endeavors.
