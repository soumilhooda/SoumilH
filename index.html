<h1> Soumil Hooda</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a third-year undergraduate student in the <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/physics/physics">Department of Physics</a> and <a href="https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/EEE/Home">Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/">BITS Pilani, Hyderabad, India</a> currently advised by <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/manik/Profile">Dr. Manik Gupta</a>.
<br> I spent my young years in 4 cities across 2 countries. I have a thing for libraries. I hold a keen interest in motorsports (mainly openwheel and production) and try and enjoy a casual game of lawn tennis every now and then.
<br> I would love to be able to interact with an electronical machine as easily as I can interact with a fellow human being in my lifetime, even better, be part of making it happen. I also love atmospheric sciences.
<br> If I am not working you can usually find me watching some documentary or reading some mystery novel/comic.
<br> Meandering my way through my interests I have found a knack for deep structured learning. </p>

<p> My current research focuses on deep structured learning and its applications.
<br> Primary research interests: deep structured learning, decision making models, computer vision and machine learning for climate change.
<br> Secondary research interests: remote sensing, meteorology and robotics. </p>
