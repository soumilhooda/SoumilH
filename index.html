<h1> Soumil Hooda</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a third-year undergraduate student in the <a href="https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/EEE/Home">Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering</a> and graduate student in the <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/physics/physics">Department of Physics</a> at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/">BITS Pilani, Hyderabad, India</a> currently advised by <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/manik/Profile">Dr. Manik Gupta</a>.</p>
<p> Here is something about me. 'Intriguing Possibilities' is my motto. I spent my young years in 4 cities across 2 countries ingraining fluidity. I hold a keen interest in motorsports (mainly openwheel and production) and try and enjoy a casual game of lawn tennis every now and then. I would love to be able to interact with a machine as easily as I can interact with a fellow human being in my lifetime, even better, be part of making it happen. I also love atmospheric sciences, cooking and libraries. If I am not working and still on my desk, you can usually find me enjoying some score, specially some Atticus Ross or reading some psychology. Meandering my way through my interests I have found a knack for deep structured learning. </p>
<p> My current research focuses on deep structured learning  for sciences. </p>
