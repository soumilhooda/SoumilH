      <p style="font-size: 40px"><strong>Hi! I'm a double degree junior at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad studying Physics and Electrical and Electronics Engineering. </strong></p> 
      <p> Meandering my way through my interests I have found a knack for deep structured learning. This summer I am researching meteorological parameter estimation at SAC, ISRO, channel estimation at CSIR-CEERI, Pilani, fuzzy learning, generative networks and remote sensing data collection/analysis at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad. </p>

       I for the most part of my life grew up in India. More specifically, Ahmedabad, India. I would love to be able to interact with an electronical machine as easily as I can interact with a fellow human being in my lifetime, even better, be part of making it happen. I run a newsletter on stuff of importance to me. I hold a keen interest in motorsports (mainly openwheel and production) and try and enjoy a casual game of lawn tennis every now and then.
