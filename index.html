      <p style="font-size: 20px"><strong>Hi! I'm a double degree junior at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad studying Physics and Electrical and Electronics Engineering. </strong></p> 
      <p> Meandering my way through my interests I have found a knack for deep structured learning. This summer I am mainly undertaking some research work and a summer school or two. </p>

       I for the most part of my life grew up in India. More specifically, Ahmedabad, India. I would love to be able to interact with an electronical machine as easily as I can interact with a fellow human being in my lifetime, even better, be part of making it happen. I also love atmospheric sciences. I run a <a href="https://buttondown.email/SoumilHooda/" style="color:rgb(0, 136, 204)">newsletter</a> on stuff of importance to me. I hold a keen interest in motorsports (mainly openwheel and production) and try and enjoy a casual game of lawn tennis every now and then. If I am not working you can usually find me watching some documentary or reading some mystery novel/comic.
