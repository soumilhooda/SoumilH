        <p>Hello! I'm a senior at the Department of Physics and Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at BITS Pilani Hyderabad.</p>
        <p>I enjoy working on all problems related to weather modelling. I am also interested in the idea of a general autonomous agent, and would like to devote some years to researching the same. I like to pass time solving Fermi questions.</p>
        <p>At present, my research focuses on usecases of deep learning models in healthcare applications, where I have been working on furthening 12-lead ECG based atrial arrhythmia detection.</p>
        <p>Did I tell you? I also worked on building a comprehensive weather risk management system for India. I believe the Indian market is highly underserved and had developed multiple products such as temperature-based derivative contracts, temperature-energy quanto contracts, rainfall-agriculture quanto contracts and wind/solar energy swaps. I also actively researched securitization for government backed insurance schemes such as the PMFBY and WBCIS.

        <p>I've been fortunate to collaborate with some wonderful researchers including <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/manik-gupta/">Prof. Manik Gupta</a>,  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/rajeshtripathy17">Prof. Rajesh Tripathy</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=LoA8R0YAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Satya Prakash Ojha</a>.</p>
